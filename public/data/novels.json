Will he pursue the path of strength alone? Or without realizing it he will become the king of the greatest empire that ever lived.***Author: This is my first story and English is not my native language, I am using Google translator to translate the story for me, I accept opinions and questions in the comments for this week's chapter.I intend to make this a long story so all the development of the Mc and the world will be slow for a proper construction, be warned.***I know the first few chapters have some errors, but I've improved my writing as I progressed through the story, after 10 chapters there won't be that many errors. Collapse \n\nMale Protagonist, Non-human Protagonist, Evolution, System, Weak to Strong, Reincarnation, Vampires, Kingdom Building\n\nThe story has potential, but it's becoming shit with all the slowness of the chapters, a lot of them seem like filler.other shit and the mc with drama all the time.MC is very mentally unstable, one moment he's cold, and says he doesn't feel anything when he kills, another he's like a little hero throwing a tantrum because he sees the suffering of random people.now crying because of a shack in the middle of the forest, when he is leaving.Damn, the MC has to be very unstable, now he cries because of a house he built\n\nFrom what the author said, it's basically a mtl\n\nI'm rating this novel ‚≠ê‚≠ê, only because my favorite kingdom building are so average no description on building town or city and her dungeon master are also average no improvement in the dungeon. What I see here are fighting in right and left and collecting subordinates or daughters. I'm still 450cht  But the story are so cool because MC have cool and kind characteristics / Skill tree and evolution line in vampire I Love all \n\nJust finished the latest chapter want more need going man don't latest people discourage you follow your passionQuote: Keith MillerJust finished the latest chapter want more. You need to keep going man don't latest people discourage you and follow your passionQuote: FiltyIncognitoI got to ch65 before the endless repetition of info and much rarer progression of plot was just too much for me. I've never seen authors cure themselves of their Filler disease, it seems to be a terminal infection, so I'm not going to try sticking it out.Read pass 70 it gets better\n\nUp to 328, started slow but got good after a while now where I am now is getting better.\n\nI got to ch65 before the endless repetition of info and much rarer progression of plot was just too much for me.

I was liking the ruthlessness and decisiveness of the MC but the he went wimpy. God dammit it was pretty good till then. \n\n¬°Hidden gem!Hidden gem\n\nLies\n\nLol\n\nDropped a few months ago. Thought was good original but hit garbage.\n\nYou want a hidden gem. Read ‚ÄúRisen world‚Äù.\n\nThanks for the recommendation. Drop this novel awhile ago.",
